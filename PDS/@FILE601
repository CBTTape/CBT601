//***FILE 601 is from Greg Price, and contains a version of QUEUE   *   FILE 601
//*           for MVS 3.8 (which is normally run under Hercules).   *   FILE 601
//*                                                                 *   FILE 601
//*           As is well known, the QUEUE program is for browsing   *   FILE 601
//*           JES2 SPOOL files, especially program print output.    *   FILE 601
//*                                                                 *   FILE 601
//*           This version of QUEUE was adapted from an early       *   FILE 601
//*           version distributed by Jack Schudel, and innovated    *   FILE 601
//*           by several early JES2 geniuses.  Greg (in his usual   *   FILE 601
//*           fashion) has spiced this version up quite a bit.      *   FILE 601
//*           Please look at member $GPDOC to see some detail       *   FILE 601
//*           about the very nice improvements to QUEUE that Greg   *   FILE 601
//*           has made.                                             *   FILE 601
